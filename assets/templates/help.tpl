    <p>The "Settings" page contains the settings to connect to i4a. For plugin to work, you need to put the <b>i4a SSO API
            WSDL Url</b>, <b>i4a SSO API Username</b> and the <b>i4a SSO API Password</b> in their respective boxes.</p>
            
    <p>The <b>SSO API WSDL Url</b> would be http://[your website domain here]/i4a/utilities/api/wordpress.cfc?WSDL.</p>
    
    <p>
    	The <b>i4a SSO API Username</b> and the <b>i4a SSO API Password</b> can be found in your site's admin interface. To find this information, log into the admin interface, go to the Admin menu and click API Settings. The API Username and Password are located here. If you do not know the password and your site uses the API for other purposes, do not change the password or the other connections to the API will be broken. 
    </p>

    <p>In the <b>Connection</b> subsection, you can set the <b>Timeout</b> to how long you want the plugin to wait in
        seconds after sending a query to i4a for a response. Addtionally you can set the <b>Connection Timeout</b>
        to how long you want the plugin to wait in seconds after initially trying to connect to i4a, before any
        queries are sent.</p>
